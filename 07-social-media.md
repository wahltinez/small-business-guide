## Social Media <a name="social-media"></a>

In the context of this guide, social media refers to any platform that allows for small businesses
to interact with potential customers. Similarly to [digital advertising](#digital-advertising),
social media requires a significant ongoing effort to be an effective tool. On the other hand,
generally speaking, the only cost of investing in a good social media presence is your time since
the most popular platforms are free to use.


### Understanding the Role of Social Media

Social media should not be seen simply as a tool to promote your business, that's the role of
digital advertising. While promoting your business is one of the benefits of having a social media
presence, the main differentiator of social media and other forms of marketing is the ability to
engage and interact with potential customers.

The interactions with customers will be different depending on the type of business. For example,
a restaurant might post special or limited time menu items whereas a bike shop might post about
biking trails in order to build a long-term relationship with their customers.


### Keeping Up with the Times

Social media platforms tend to change very rapidly. Either by their rise (and fall), or by the
change of the demographics of their user base. To use social media effectively, you should keep up
with what your potential customers are using â€” and potentially ignore the social media platforms
that you might be most familiar with.

Further, each social media platform has its own conventions and rules, and you should not treat them
all equally. For example, in some platforms, businesses can be expected to publish new content at
most weekly but in others daily new content would be considered acceptable.
