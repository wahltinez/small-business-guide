<h2>About This Guide <a name="about-this-guide"></a></h2>
<p>We (Sarah and Oscar) are avid travelers and love to support local businesses around the world. We
enjoy experiencing the different cultures and learning all about them, so finding small, authentic,
local businesses is one of our favorite activities anywhere we go.</p>
<p>Small businesses, especially those based outside of the USA, sometimes are not very <em>tech-savvy</em>. We
get it, running a small business is a very difficult and demanding task. Small business owners have
enough things to worry about! But in order to grow as a business it is imperative to develop a good
online presence.</p>
<p>For physical stores, having a good storefront is very important to encourage potential customers to
walk in. Similarly, businesses need a good online presence to reach out to more potential customers.
What constitutes a good online presence depends on the type of business. Most businesses could
benefit from having a website and social media. Businesses with a physical storefront should have a
Google Maps listing. Businesses looking to attract tourists should have a TripAdvisor and Yelp
listing.</p>
<p>When we talk to the business owners and ask them about their online presence, many times they either
didn't know about what they could be doing better, or don't have the knowledge and skills to improve
how potential customers can interact with their businesses online. As part of our desire to support
the small, authentic, local businesses we decided to write this guide to address some of the most
common problems we find in the online presence for these type of businesses.</p>
<p>You won't find advanced business or marketing strategies in this guide, and if your business already
appears in Google Maps, or you have a working website, then you probably won't learn much from this
guide. You might still want to check it out to make sure you maximize the benefits of a strong
online presence for your business.</p>
<h2>Online Accounts <a name="online-accounts"></a></h2>
<p>Almost all of the services mentioned in this guide will require for you to create an account. It is
very important to keep track of which accounts have been created and where.</p>
<h3>Google Account</h3>
<p>Many of the free services suggested in this guide are provided by Google, which makes most of its
money from digital advertising. By providing free services and encouraging businesses and consumers
to move to a digital economy, the number of people that can be served by digital advertising
increases which is highly beneficial to Google.</p>
<p>We recommend that you create a Google account specifically for your business. The Google account
will provide you with email, storage, calendar, and more — all for free. Preferably, use the name
of your business for the account name. If your business has a common name which is already taken,
you can also add the location of your business to find an available account name; for example,
<code>mybusinessname.seattle@gmail.com</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> dots in your account name are ignored by Google, so you can use them to break up the
different words and make it easier to read and spell.</p>
<h3>Managing Passwords</h3>
<p>In some cases, it can be extremely difficult to recover an account if the password is lost. At the
same time, passwords should be difficult to guess, include a mix of numbers, letters and special
characters, and should not be reused for different accounts.</p>
<p>There are a couple of ways to handle this problem. First, when the option is available, it can be
avoided altogether if you choose the "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Facebook" options.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we highly recommend using a trusted password manager. They are considered secure and make
managing complex passwords much easier. Most web browsers have a built-in password manager. If you
use <a href="https://google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>, the passwords will synchronize with your Google account. For a
cross-platform solution, we recommend <a href="https://lastpass.com">LastPass</a> since it can be used on any type of device.</p>
<h3>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h3>
<p>Many accounts, including those for Google and Facebook, can be further secured by the use of
two-factor authentication (2FA). 2FA relies on two components: something you know (like a password)
and something you have (for example a phone). 2FA might be slightly inconvenient, especially if you
have to log into an account often, but it provides a significant increase in security. For something
as important as your business, we recommend setting up 2FA for the accounts that support it.</p>
<h2>Creating a Website <a name="creating-a-website"></a></h2>
<p>One of the main places to tell customers about your business online is via a website. Creating a
website is <strong>very easy and free</strong>, but it's very important to keep it simple and up to date. There
are two components in the management of a business website:</p>
<ol>
<li>The web page content that customers see</li>
<li>The web address, also known as the domain name</li>
</ol>
<p>The web page content is the most important thing, and can be done completely free of charge.
Normally this will result in a web address like <code>https://sites.google.com/view/mybusinessname</code> or
<code>https://mybusinessname.wordpress.com</code>. If you want to have a custom domain name like
<code>https://mybusinessname.com</code> you need to purchase it with a domain registrar, and pay yearly to
maintain it. Prices typically are between $10 and $14 per year.</p>
<h3>Do You Need a Website?</h3>
<p>One of the first questions you need to ask yourself is: Do you really need a website? Some
businesses only have a Facebook page and that seems to work just fine. While social media presence
is important for interacting with existing customers and sharing updates about your business, a
website is like a storefront for all potential customers.</p>
<p>However, websites need to be maintained so the information stays up to date. If you don't plan on
spending at least 1-2 hours per month maintaining your website, then a website might not be the best
idea: having an outdated website can be worse for your business than having no website at all.
Rather, consider maintaining a <a href="#social-media">social media</a> page or a
<a href="#google-my-business">Google My Business</a> listing instead.</p>
<h3>Creating a Free Website</h3>
<p>There are many tools and companies that can help you create a website for free. In most cases, they
have a "free" plan and a "premium" plan you can upgrade to. The free website builder we recommend
is <a href="https://google.com/chrome/">Google Sites</a>. The main reason is that they don't have a "premium"
plan, so the free version has all the features you need and you can't be tricked into paying for
more features you don't need. The only thing that you might be asked to pay for is a custom
domain name, which is not necessary to publish your website.</p>
<p>To create a free website using Google Sites, just go to <a href="https://sites.google.com">https://sites.google.com</a> from a desktop
computer, log in using your Google account, and follow the instructions on the screen. We recommend
starting from one of the templates from the template gallery at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Once you are done building your website, <strong>it's very important to test it</strong>. Make sure it works at
least for the following combination of devices:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone</li>
<li>Android phone</li>
<li>Desktop computer or laptop</li>
</ul>
<h3>Alternatives to Google Sites</h3>
<p>We recommend Google Sites because it's simple and highly customizable. However, there are many more
free website builders. Some well-known products which have a free base plan are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.com">Wordpress</a></li>
<li><a href="https://weebly.com">Weebly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://squarespace.com">SquareSpace</a></li>
<li><a href="https://strikingly.com">Strikingly</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't want to create your own website and want to pay someone to do it, there are many
digital agencies that can create a website for you. This is a relatively expensive solution, but
will have the most <em>professional</em> results. You should never pay more than $1,000 for a custom
website.</p>
<h3>Purchasing a Custom Domain</h3>
<p>When you create a website with Google Sites, you will end up with an address like
<code>https://sites.google.com/view/mybusinessname</code>. If you want to have a custom domain name, like
<code>https://mybusinessname.com</code>, you'll need to purchase it from a domain registrar. We recommend using
<a href="https://lastpass.com">Google Domains</a> since that will make it very easy to link your web page to your domain name.
Alternatively, you can also purchase a domain from <a href="https://sites.google.com">CloudFlare</a> or <a href="https://domains.google.com">GoDaddy</a>.</p>
<h3>Professional Email</h3>
<p>If you would like to have a more professional-looking email address, you will need to purchase a
domain name and also pay an email hosting provider. When choosing an email hosting provider, keep
in mind that many providers appear cheap, but that's because they have an introductory pricing which
typically expires after a year. Some web and email hosting providers employ predatory business
practices meant to take advantage of small business owners. For that reason, we recommend using
established, reputable companies.</p>
<p>The main options for professional email which we recommend are <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/">Microsoft 365</a> and
<a href="https://godaddy.com">Google Workspace</a>. Email hosting providers are normally in the range of $5-10 per month.
Technically, there is a way to use an existing GMail account with a custom domain, but it can be
complex to set up and it's not covered in this guide — if you are still interested, search for "free
custom domain email with gmail" and you'll find many step-by-step guides.</p>
<h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>
<p>Search Engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking and appearance of your web
presence to the eyes of search engines, namely Google. Google's Search engine uses proprietary
algorithms to determine which results to display first in the list of search results. Generally
speaking, the priority is relevance, compatibility and speed.</p>
<p>There are many (multi-million) businesses that focus on SEO. For a small business, we don't
recommend paying for any SEO-related services. We also don't recommend trying to worry too much
about SEO, since a lot of SEO-focused business essentially play a game of cat and mouse trying to
fool Google's algorithm which changes often.</p>
<p>To optimize the ranking in Google Search results, keep the website up to date with relevant
information about your business and the services it provides, make sure that it loads fast and that
it works well on desktop and mobile devices.</p>
<p>You should also make sure that your business appears in Google Search results often by searching for
your business name. Sometimes, your website may stop appearing in the search results even if you
have not made any changes. You can troubleshoot issues like that and tweak how your website is
treated by Google Search from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business">Google Search Console</a>. You can also find more information
about this topic in <a href="https://workspace.google.com/">Google Search Central</a>.</p>
<h2>Electronic Payments <a name="electronic-payments"></a></h2>
<p>Electronic payments refer to any form of payment other than cash. This typically includes credit
card payments, but can also refer to cryptocurrency.</p>
<h3>E-Commerce</h3>
<p>E-Commerce is a term that refers to selling goods and services online. Even if your business only
deals with physical goods or services at the store's location, you can also take advantage of
e-commerce by offering pre-payment of those goods or services. For example, a restaurant may offer
a pre-paid special dinner package. Other businesses may offer redeemable vouchers.</p>
<h3>Processing Electronic Payments</h3>
<p>In order to be able to process electronic payments, you have to work with a local bank that can provide
what is called a Point of Sale (POS) system. Depending on the local circumstances and your
particular business, banks may impose some (sometimes seemingly unreasonable) requirements.</p>
<p>If it's feasible for your business, consider asking customer to pre-pay so you can sell your
products or services online.</p>
<h3>Selling Products or Services Online</h3>
<p>Businesses that want the ability to sell products or services online need for a way to process
credit card payments on their website. Even if you already have the ability to process electronic
payments at your physical business location, you likely need to find another payment provider to
process online payments. There are no free solutions that will work for this, most payment providers
will charge a monthly fee in addition to credit card fees. Normally, maintenance fees should be
under $30 per month and credit card fees range from 3-4% + 30-60¢ per transaction.</p>
<p>We recommend using <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/online-store">Square Online</a>, which does not charge a
monthly fee for their base plan and includes tool to help you build your website. A very popular
alternative is <a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a>, but that can be more expensive for small
businesses.</p>
<h3>Handling Credit Card Information</h3>
<p>Avoid handling customer credit card information. If that's not possible for logistical reasons,
avoid storing customer credit card information in any form. By using one of the payment providers we
recommend above, the credit card information is never stored in your online properties and all the
liability of processing customer credit card information is handled by the payment provider.</p>
<h2>Google My Business <a name="google-my-business"></a></h2>
<p>Google is crucial in how potential customers can find out about your business online. Particularly,
Google Search and Google Maps are two products widely used that can be leveraged to make your
business easier to find online. <a href="https://business.google.com/">Google My Business</a> is a collection of tools provided by Google
to help business owners manage a number of relevant Google services.</p>
<p>When you first sign up for Google My Business, Google may require you to enter the mailing address
for your business so they can verify that it indeed belongs to you.</p>
<h3>Google Search</h3>
<p>Even though most optimizations for Google Search are done as part of the website design, linking
your website with Google My Business ensures that Google understands that your website belongs to a
business and can provide richer information as part of the search results. To put it simply, the
more information Google has about your business, the more likely it is for your business to be
highly ranked in relevant search queries.</p>
<h3>Google Maps</h3>
<p>Google Maps is a very important tool for potential customers to discover your business. While your
business may already appear on Google Maps, it's very important to link it to your Google My
Business profile so you can manage the listing. This includes editing the description and category
for your business, selecting which photos appear in Google Maps, as well as replying to user
reviews.</p>
<h3>Website</h3>
<p>Google My Business also provides a very simple website builder. It is not very customizable, so we
recommend building your website as explained in the <a href="#creating-a-website">Creating A Website</a>
section instead. Make sure that your website is linked to your Google My Business listing by
entering the web address as part of your business information.</p>
<h3>User Reviews</h3>
<p>If you reply to user reviews, especially if they are negative, be sure to always be polite and
civil. While you can flag a user review as inappropriate for violating Google's policies, Google
will not remove any negative reviews if you and the customer disagree about facts which Google has
no way of discerning who is right. For more information about the process for requesting the removal
of user reviews, see the <a href="https://support.google.com/business/answer/4596773">Google My Business help page</a>.</p>
<h2>Digital Advertising <a name="digital-advertising"></a></h2>
<p>Digital advertising are promotional messages delivered over the internet. It is a multi-billion
dollar industry, and it is expected to continue to grow as reliable internet access expands across
the world. It can be one of the most efficient ways to reach out to potential customers, thanks to
the benefits of targeted advertising.</p>
<h3>Targeted Advertising</h3>
<p>Targeted advertising consists in focusing on a very specific audience, tailoring the promotional
messages to them and only advertising to a subset of potential customers that fit a certain
criteria.</p>
<p>While not all digital advertising is targeted advertising, targeted advertising has been the major
factor for the growth in digital advertising and thus it represents the majority of the industry.
For most purposes, the terms digital and targeted advertising are used interchangeably.</p>
<h3>How Digital Advertising Works</h3>
<p>Some digital advertising platforms may differ, but most of them make use of a real-time bidding
system. When a potential customer visits a certain website, there may be one or more advertising
<em>slots</em> to be filled with promotional content in that page. While the website loads, the digital
advertising platform initiates an auction for the advertising slots, and advertisers bid to display
their promotional message. This all happens in a matter of milliseconds, every time a user visits
the website.</p>
<p>Digital advertising platforms often collect information about the user in order to enable
advertisers to target specific audiences more likely to lead to a certain business goal, which in
the context of digital advertising is called a <em>conversion</em>.</p>
<h3>Risks of Digital Advertising</h3>
<p>Advertising online can be extremely beneficial for your business, but if it's not done right it can
also be a huge waste of money. In order to maximize the benefits of digital advertising, business
owners need to first spend a significant amount of effort learning how digital advertising works. In
addition to that, maintaining digital ads that lead to tangible business growth requires a large,
ongoing time commitment. For that reason, we recommend that small businesses limit their investment
in digital advertising and instead spend the effort and money on more traditional forms of marketing
or on growing the core part of their business.</p>
<h3>Facebook Ads</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads">Facebook Ads</a> is one of the most successful advertising platforms that small businesses have
access to. Because of the large amount of information that Facebook has about users across their
platforms, which include Instagram and WhatsApp, advertisers can target their promotional messages
to very specific audiences.</p>
<h3>Google AdWords</h3>
<p><a href="https://ads.google.com/">Google AdWords</a> is arguably the longest-lived, most successful digital advertising platform
in existence. Since Google AdWords is mainly used to deliver advertising to users of Google Search,
what the users are looking for is used as the most important. Even though it is an extremely
powerful tool, compared to Facebook Ads, it can be significantly more difficult to maximize the
benefit of using Google AdWords.</p>
