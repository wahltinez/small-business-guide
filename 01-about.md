## About This Guide <a name="about-this-guide"></a>

We are avid travelers and love to support local businesses around the world. We enjoy experiencing
the different cultures and learning all about them, so finding small, authentic, local businesses is
one of our favorite activities anywhere we go.

Small businesses, especially those based outside of the USA, sometimes are not very *tech-savvy*. We
get it, running a small business is a very difficult and demanding task. Small business owners have
enough things to worry about! But in order to grow as a business it is extremely important to
develop a good online presence.

For physical stores, having a good storefront is very important to encourage potential customers to
walk in. Similarly, businesses need a good online presence to reach out to more potential customers.
What constitutes a good online presence depends on the type of business. Most businesses could
benefit from having a website and social media. Businesses with a physical storefront should have a
Google Maps listing. Businesses looking to attract tourists should have a TripAdvisor and Yelp
listing.

When we talk to the business owners and ask them about their online presence, many times they either
didn't know about what they could be doing better, or don't have the knowledge and skills to improve
how potential customers can interact with their businesses online. As part of our desire to support
the small, authentic, local businesses we decided to write this guide to address some of the most
common problems we find in the online presence for these type of businesses.

You won't find advanced business or marketing strategies in this guide, and if your business already
appears in Google Maps, or you have a working website and are tech-savvy, then you probably won't
learn much since most of the things covered by this guide are common sense. Although you might still
want to check it out to make sure you maximize the benefits of a strong online presence for your
business.
