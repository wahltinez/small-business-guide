## Google My Business <a name="google-my-business"></a>

Google is crucial in how potential customers can find out about your business online. Particularly,
Google Search and Google Maps are two products widely used that can be leveraged to make your
business easier to find online. [Google My Business][13] is a collection of tools provided by Google
to help business owners manage a number of relevant Google services.

When you first sign up for Google My Business, Google may require you to enter the mailing address
for your business so they can verify that it indeed belongs to you.


### Google Search

Even though most optimizations for Google Search are done as part of the website design, linking
your website with Google My Business ensures that Google understands that your website belongs to a
business and can provide richer information as part of the search results. To put it simply, the
more information Google has about your business, the more likely it is for your business to be
highly ranked in relevant search queries.


### Google Maps

Google Maps is a very important tool for potential customers to discover your business. While your
business may already appear on Google Maps, it's very important to link it to your Google My
Business profile so you can manage the listing. This includes editing the description and category
of your business, selecting which photos appear in Google Maps, as well as replying to user reviews.


### Website

Google My Business also provides a very simple website builder. It is not very customizable, so we
recommend building your website as explained in the [Creating A Website](#creating-a-website)
section instead. Make sure that your website is linked to your Google My Business listing by
entering the web address as part of your business information.


### User Reviews

If you reply to user reviews, especially if they are negative, be sure to always be polite and
civil. While you can flag a user review as inappropriate for violating Google's policies, Google
will not remove any negative reviews if you and the customer disagree about facts which Google has
no way of discerning who is right. For more information about the process for requesting the removal
of user reviews, see the [Google My Business help page][14].
