## Creating a Website <a name="creating-a-website"></a>

One of the main places to tell customers about your business online is via a website. Creating a
website is **very easy and free**, but it's very important to keep it simple and up to date. There
are two components in the management of a business website:

1. The web page content that customers see
1. The web address, also known as the domain name

The web page content is the most important thing, and can be done completely free of charge.
Normally this will result in a web address like `https://sites.google.com/view/mybusinessname` or
`https://mybusinessname.mystrikingly.com`. If you want to have a custom domain name like
`https://mybusinessname.com` you need to purchase it with a domain registrar, and pay yearly to
maintain it. Prices typically are between $10 and $14 per year.


### Do You Need a Website?

One of the first questions you need to ask yourself is: Do you really need a website? Some
businesses only have a Facebook page and that seems to work just fine. While social media presence
is important for interacting with existing customers and sharing updates about your business, a
website is like a storefront for all potential customers.

However, websites need to be maintained so the information stays up to date. If you don't plan on
spending at least 1-2 hours per month maintaining your website, then a website might not be the best
idea: having an outdated website can be worse for your business than having no website at all.
Rather, consider maintaining a [social media](#social-media) page or a
[Google My Business](#google-my-business) listing instead.


### Creating a Free Website

There are many tools and companies that can help you create a website for free. In most cases, they
have a "free" plan and a "premium" plan you can upgrade to. The free website builder we recommend
is [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com). The main reason is that they don't have a "premium"
plan, so the free version has all the features you need and you can't be tricked into paying for
more features you don't need. The only thing that you might be asked to pay for is a custom
domain name, which is not necessary to publish your website.

To create a free website using Google Sites, just go to <https://sites.google.com> from a desktop
computer, log in using your Google account, and follow the instructions on the screen. We recommend
starting from one of the templates from the template gallery at the top of the page.

Once you are done building your website, **it's very important to test it**. Make sure it works at
least for the following combination of devices:

* iPhone
* Android phone
* Desktop computer or laptop


### Purchasing a Custom Domain

When you create a website with Google Sites, you will end up with an address like
`https://sites.google.com/view/mybusinessname`. If you want to have a custom domain name, like
`https://mybusinessname.com`, you'll need to purchase it from a domain registrar. We recommend using
[Google Domains](https://domains.google.com) since that will make it very easy to link your web page
to your domain name. Alternatively, you can also purchase a domain from
[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/) or [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com).


### Alternatives to Google Sites

We recommend Google Sites because it's simple and highly customizable. However, there are many more
website builders. Some well-known products which have a free base plan are:

* [Weebly](https://weebly.com)
* [SquareSpace](https://squarespace.com)
* [Strikingly](https://strikingly.com)


### Paying for a Custom Website

If you don't want to create your own website and want to pay someone to do it, there are many
digital agencies that can create a website for you. This is a relatively expensive solution, but
will have the most *professional* results. You should never pay more than $1,000 for a custom
website.


### Selling Products Online

Businesses that want the ability to sell products online need for a way to process credit card
payments on their website. Even if you already have the ability to process electronic payments at
your physical business location, you likely need to find another payment provider to process online
payments. There are no free solutions that will work for this, most payment providers will charge
a monthly fee in addition to credit card fees. Normally, maintenance fees should be under $30 per
month and credit card fees range from 3-4% + 30-60Â¢ per transaction.

We recommend using [Square Online](https://squareup.com/us/en/online-store), which does not charge a
monthly fee for their base plan and includes tool to help you build your website. A very popular
alternative is [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/), but that can be more expensive for small
businesses.
