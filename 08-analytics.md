## Analytics <a name="analytics"></a>

A famous quote used in the context of analytics is "if you can't measure it, you can't improve it".
If you want to attract more potential customers by establishing an online presence, then you should
also keep track of certain metrics to make sure that what you are doing is working.


### Website Analytics

There are many website analytics products, but many of them are short-lived and have very limited
free options. We recommend using [Google Analytics][20], which is one of the most powerful products
available and also completely free. If you used Google Sites for your website, [here are the
instructions][21] for setting up analytics. If you built your website some other way, go to the
[Google Analytics website][20] for more info.

If you don't want to use a Google product, [Clicky][22] is a good alternative. You can also use
[Bit.ly][23], but that's limited to only tracking visitors to your website coming from the short
links created with their platform. There's also [Facebook Analytics][24], but it's a complex tool
which might require a large time investment.


### Social Media Analytics

Social media platforms provide analytics about user engagement in different ways. For example,
you can see the metrics related to your business' Facebook page with Facebook's [Page Insights][25].
Other platforms, such as Instagram, YouTube, etc. have the equivalent tools to keep track of user
engagement with your social media posts.
