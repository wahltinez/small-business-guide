## Creating a Website <a name="creating-a-website"></a>

One of the main places to tell customers about your business online is with a website. Creating a
website is **very easy and free**, but it's very important to keep it simple and up to date. There
are two components in the management of a business website:

1. The web page content that customers see
1. The web address, also known as the domain name

The web page content is the most important thing, and can be done completely free of charge.
Normally this will result in a web address like `https://sites.google.com/view/mybusinessname` or
`https://mybusinessname.wordpress.com`. If you want to have a custom domain name like
`https://mybusinessname.com` you need to purchase it with a domain registrar, and pay yearly to
maintain it.


### Do You Need a Website?

One of the first questions you need to ask yourself is: Do you really need a website? Some
businesses only have a Facebook page and that seems to work just fine. While social media presence
is important for interacting with existing customers and sharing updates about your business, a
website is like a storefront for all potential customers.

However, websites need to be maintained so the information stays up to date. If you don't plan on
spending at least 1-2 hours per month maintaining your website, then a website might not be the best
idea: having an outdated website can be worse for your business than having no website at all.
Rather, consider maintaining a [social media](#social-media) page or a
[Google My Business](#google-my-business) listing instead.

Note: If you would like to sell products and services directly from your website, you should
consider the options mentioned in the [Electronic Payments](#electronic-payments) section.


### Creating Website for Free

There are many tools and companies that can help you create a website for free. In most cases, they
have a "free" plan and a "premium" plan that you can upgrade to. The free website builder we
recommend is [Google Sites][1]. The main reason is that they don't have a "premium" plan, so the
free version has all the features you need and you can't be tricked into paying for more features
that you don't need. The only thing that you might be asked to pay for is a custom domain name,
which is not necessary to publish your website.

To create a free website using Google Sites, just go to <https://sites.google.com> from a desktop
computer, log in using your Google account, and follow the instructions on the website. We recommend
starting from one of the templates from the template gallery at the top of the page.

Once you are done building your website, **it's very important to test it**. Make sure it works at
least for the following combination of devices:

* iPhone
* Android phone
* Desktop computer or laptop

You should ask your friends and family for help testing your website. Not only can they help you
make sure your website looks good in different devices, but they can also give you feedback about
how the design and the content.


### Alternatives to Google Sites

We recommend Google Sites because it's simple and highly customizable. However, there are many more
free website builders. Some well-known products which have a free base plan are:

* [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com)
* [Weebly](https://weebly.com)
* [SquareSpace](https://squarespace.com)
* [Strikingly](https://strikingly.com)

If you don't want to create your own website and want to pay someone to do it, there are many
digital agencies that can create a website for you. This is a relatively expensive solution, but
will have the most *professional* results. You should never pay more than $1,000 for a custom
website, and keep in mind that many agencies will charge monthly maintenance costs even if the
website is not updated with new content. Some agencies retain ownership of the website, so when you
stop paying, the website is taken down — make sure that you review the terms of the contract.


### Purchasing a Custom Domain

When you create a website with Google Sites, you will end up with an address like
`https://sites.google.com/view/mybusinessname`. If you want to have a custom domain name, like
`https://mybusinessname.com`, you'll need to purchase it from a domain registrar. We recommend using
[Google Domains][2] since that will make it very easy to link your web page to your domain name.
Alternatively, you can also purchase a domain from [CloudFlare][3] or [GoDaddy][4]. Prices typically
are between $10 and $14 per year.

Consider that to keep your custom domain, you will need to pay for it yearly. If you decide to stop
paying, anyone can purchase the domain after it expires and you will have no control over the
content.


### Professional Email

If you would like to have a more professional-looking email address,
like `contact@mybusinessname.com`, you will need to purchase a domain name and also pay an email
hosting provider. When choosing an email hosting provider, keep in mind that many providers appear
cheap, but that's because they have an introductory pricing which typically expires after a year.
Some web and email hosting providers employ predatory business practices meant to take advantage of
small business owners. For that reason, we recommend using established, reputable companies.

The main options for professional email which we recommend are [Microsoft 365][5] and
[Google Workspace][6]. Email hosting providers are normally in the range of $5-10 per month.
Technically, there is a way to use an existing GMail account with a custom domain, but it can be
complex to set up and it's not covered in this guide — if you are still interested, search for "free
custom domain email with gmail" and you'll find many step-by-step guides.


### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Search Engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the ranking and appearance of your web
presence to the eyes of search engines, namely Google. Google's Search engine uses proprietary
algorithms to determine which websites to display first in the list of search results. Generally
speaking, the priorities are relevance, compatibility and speed.

There are many (multi-million) businesses that focus on SEO. For a small business, we don't
recommend paying for any SEO-related services. We also don't recommend trying to worry too much
about SEO, since a lot of SEO-focused business essentially play a game of cat and mouse trying to
fool Google's algorithm which changes often.

To optimize the ranking in Google Search results, keep the website up to date with relevant
information about your business and the services it provides, make sure that it loads fast and that
it works well on desktop and mobile devices.

You should also make sure that your business appears in Google Search results often by searching for
your business name. Sometimes, your website may stop appearing in the search results even if you
have not made any changes. You can troubleshoot issues like that and tweak how your website is
treated by Google Search from the [Google Search Console][7]. You can also find more information
about this topic in [Google Search Central][8].
